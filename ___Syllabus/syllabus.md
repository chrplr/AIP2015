Introduction to Programming (AIP)
=================================

Objectives:

* Learn what is a computer, what is a program
* Learn the basics of a programming language (Python)
* Learn about the process of executing, writing and debugging programs
* Learning about the process of moving from a problem statement to a computational formulation of a method for solving the problem


Knowledge to be acquired:


Practical skills
================

You should know how to:

* Download some source code (e.g. Python) from the Internet (e.g. github) and display it.
* Run a program from the command line 
 - open a terminal, interact with the shell
 - navigate the directory structure with cd/ls
 - type commands, possibily with options or arguments
 - interrupt a running program (using the process manager)

* Execute a python script.
* Install missing modules
* Launch ipython and use it interactively (distinction shell/interpreter python)
* Use an editor (atom) to view/edit a Python script
* Find/read Python's documentation
* what to do when there is a crash/error message


Programming concepts
====================

* the basic element: the instruction. simple program=sequences of instructions
* forever loops
* conditional statements
* constants integers/floats/strings (insist that there are different types) 
* variables
* lists/dictionaries 
* loops over sequences
* functions/parameters/local variables
* modules
* file input/output


Algorithmic concepts
====================
(building blocs)


Basic concepts


* search/filter items in lists
* finding the maximum in a list of integer 
* using a dictionary to count words in a text


Advanced notions

* searching a substring in a string
* (optional) trees (list of lists)
* functions as objects
* notions of event driven program (callback functions)


Methodology of programming
===========================

* divide-and-conquer approach, piping
* writing code following our coding standards (see below)
* debug with 'print'



Computer architecture concepts
==============================

* The secret of computer power revealed (Dan Dennett)
(A theoretical computer: the register machine.). 

? Turing machines/lamdba calculus

* Modern computer = Processor + Memory   + Disk + keyboard+ Screen.
* Organisation of files: Directory structure. 
* Interacting with the computer: Terminal vs. GUI.
* What is a program: executables vs. source code/compilation and
interpretation.


Our Coding standards
====================

* use a common template for all scripts
* force writing docstrings with aim, input & output descriptions
* avoid global variables except for constants (use uppercase for identifier)
* spaces around operators, after ',',...
* use explicit names (lowercase ascii)
* use comments sparingly, explain why, not how 
* factorisation de code (each step is a function, put docstrings)

Get to the point where you can run a Monte Carlo estimation of pi.
 

First steps in Python with the Turtle module

* modern computer

Processor + Memory   + Disk + keyboard+ Screen.

Organisation of files: Directory structure. 

Interacting with the computer: Terminal vs. GUI.

What is a program: executables vs. source code/compilation and
interpretation.

If you download some source code (e.g. Python) from the internet, how
to execute it?

Knowledge to be acquired:

- how to run a python program from the command line 
(knowing how to open a terminal/find the location of a file/cd to the correct folder/type a command/pass arguments)

- how to use an editor to view/edit a python script

Read and execute a few examples of python scripts.

Topics: How are objects represented in the computer memory/ or disk: numbers
(integers), text, images...





Programming 101 in Python. 
-------------------------

constants (Strings, numbers, tuples, dictionnaries)

variables

conditional statements

iterating on lists

functions


Must be able to write a function that computes the mean of a list of numbers


Lecture 5. Programming 102: file I/O. string manipulation.
----------------------------------------------------------
Write a program that counts the number of words in a text file

automate fini. language regulier

Regular expressions. Searching a textual database such as lexique
(warning: not to use in simple cases)




Lecture 3. Interactive use of the computer with ipython (notebook?)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Mathematics and Data exploration with numpy, pandas
