**Course 00: Software Installation** Wednesday September 2 2015
============================================================

Objectives
----------

Each student should end up with a bundle of softwares which are needed in the
mandatory courses of the Cogmaster.

You migh skip the last one if and only if you are already used to an advanced
text editor as wim, emacs, sublimetext. Microsoft Office Word, LibreOffice and
other document formatting software are
**not** text editors.

Important notes
---------------

The **only** slot in the schedule dedicated to installation of softwares is on
Wednesday 2 September from 9:00 to 12:00. We will **not** answer installation
questions during the following AIP lectures. We will not try to solve your
problems if you were not attending on Wednesday morning. If you don't have a
computer yet, tell us after the AIP presentation on Monday 31 August.

Backup your computer on monday evening.

Installation procedures are currently being tested on Windows (7 64bits), MacOS
(10.9 Maverick), and debian-based linux. We have have few years of experience with installations on various Operating System versions, but there is always some computers on which the usual procedures and fixes fail. We will try our best, if it happens to you, please be patient.

Some installations will require an internet access, thus don't forget to
bring your login and password for the ENS wifi on wednesday morning.

Installation procedures will be put online on Tuesday. Links will be provided to download the installation files from the internet. Try much as possible to downloaded on your computer Tuesday evening: it will save us some time on Wednesday morning because the network at the ENS is usually slow and we will have only few USB sticks with the softwares.

If you are using a debian-based Linux such as Ubuntu, most of the installations will be made with apt, it is way safer to try the installation at your home if you have a decent internet connection than Wednesday at the ENS.
