In the terminal, you are interacting with a program called a *shell*.

This program waits for you to type commands with the keyboard.

In this lecture, you will just need to know very few commands:

- **Linux/MacOSX** pwd, cd, python, ipython

- **Windows cmd** echo %cd%, cd, python, ipython


To learn more, see the lectures 'how computers work' and 'how to use a computer interactively'.
