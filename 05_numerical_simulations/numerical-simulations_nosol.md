The aim is to assess how well the proportion in a sample estimates the proportion in a population.

1. Create a population of N=1 million voters out of which 52% support a candidate A, and the rest support candidate B. Use a numpy array.


2. Extract a random sample of s=100 voters and compute the proportion of A supporters.


3. Rerun the preceding process 1000 times and plot an histogram of the estimated proportions (using matplotlib.pyplot.hist).  



Exercice: Modify s, the size of the sample, and compute the standard deviation of the sampled means as a function of s.
